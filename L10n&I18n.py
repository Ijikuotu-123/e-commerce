#LOCALIZATION
# localization is what a product would look like if you were a native of the market
# adapting features
# modifying content
#converting to local units and currencies 
# using proper local format for dates, addresses, phone number e.tc

#INTERNALIZATION
# internationlization is the process of planning and implementing a product so it can be localized
# e.g implementing a feature that will allow us add new lauguages to the product. Note the act of translating from 
# from language to another isn't internalization but the features we have added that enable us do that.

# TRANSLATION
# Translation is the process of writing strings in one locale into another e.g British English to American English. And 
# not from one language to another
# English language can be American English, Canadian English e.t.c American English for example represent a locale
# steps to achieve this:
# 1. separate strings from your codes
# 2. add an internalization layer to make adding new translations a breeze

# note all our strings will be transported into a folder/directory called strings
